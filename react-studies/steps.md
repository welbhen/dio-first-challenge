# This is a step-by-step description of what was done on this project/study.

1. open the ```dio-tqi-fullstack-bootcamp-challenges/react-studies``` dir on your terminal.
2. run the command ```npx create-react-app hooks-class```.
3. run the command ```cd hooks-class``` in order to enter the react-app dir.
4. run ```npm start``` to start the project on http://localhost:3000/.
5. inside ```dio-tqi-fullstack-bootcamp-challenges/react-studies/hooks/class``` delete the following files, because we'll not use them:
    a. ```.../src```
        - App.test.js
        - reportWebVitals.js
        - setupTests.js

6. delete the code lines containg 'reportWebVitals' from ```.../src/index.js```.
7. create a dir 'Components' inside ```.../src```.
8. for each component create a dir inside ```.../src/Components```, for exemple: ```.../src/Components/App```.
9. edit the App.js component.
    - Optional: you can change the App.js component to be an 'arrow function' insted of a regular function.
10. create the Counter component and do NOT use react-hooks.
11. create the SmartCounter component and now use react-hooks.
12. create the IfoodCounter component.
